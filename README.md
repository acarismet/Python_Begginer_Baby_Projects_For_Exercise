# Python_Begginer_Projects_For_Exercise
This repository contains beginner projects that I've done by myself without help. That's why I'm uplouding them.
Feel free to look at and use. Maybe you can fork it by writing better one.
I will add project descriptions to all of them.
If I had problem, also add what exactly problem is and how I solve it.
Because I'm self-taught, I'm feeling to have to explain some details that might looks like so easy and unnecessary to you.
But all points that I explained are so vaulable for me in this self-learning path.
